Sure! Here's a **friendly and modern English explanation** of the code you shared, written in clear Markdown format—perfect for a GitHub README:

## 📦 Understanding the Code – React Without JSX

```javascript
const App = () => {
  return React.createElement(
    "div",
    {},
    React.createElement("h1", {}, "Pixel Perfect Pizzas")
  );
};

const container = document.getElementById("root");
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(container);
root.render(React.createElement(App));
```

### 🧠 What's Going On Here?

This is a **vanilla React app** written without JSX (the syntax we usually see in modern React). Here's a breakdown of what each line does, in plain English:

---

### 🔧 `const App = () => { ... }`

We’re defining a functional React component called `App`. Instead of returning JSX like `<h1>Hello</h1>`, we return something more raw: a call to `React.createElement`.

---

### 🧱 `React.createElement(...)`

This function tells React what to **build in the virtual DOM**. It takes three arguments:

```js
React.createElement(type, props, ...children)
```

For example:

```js
React.createElement("h1", {}, "Pixel Perfect Pizzas")
```

Means:

> “Hey React, create an `<h1>` element, with no props, and the text inside should be ‘Pixel Perfect Pizzas’.”

Then we wrap that in a `<div>`:

```js
React.createElement("div", {}, /* the h1 goes here */)
```

So `App` ends up rendering:

```html
<div>
  <h1>Pixel Perfect Pizzas</h1>
</div>
```

---

### 🪄 Why Not Just Use JSX?

JSX is just **syntactic sugar**. It makes code prettier and easier to write—but under the hood, **React always turns JSX into `React.createElement` calls** anyway.
So this is basically what React sees *after compiling* your JSX.

---

### 🔌 The Final Part: Rendering

```js
const container = document.getElementById("root");
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(container);
root.render(React.createElement(App));
```

* We grab the `<div id="root">` from the HTML file.
* We create a React root using `ReactDOM.createRoot(...)`.
* We tell React: "Render the `App` component inside the root."

---

### 🤓 TL;DR

* You're manually doing what JSX usually does for you.
* `React.createElement` is the raw way to build elements in React.
* It's useful to understand this because **it shows how React really works** behind the scenes.
* Once you get this, using JSX will feel even more powerful and clear.
