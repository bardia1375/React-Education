# What Is the DOM?

The DOM (Document Object Model) represents a web page as a tree structure. Every piece of HTML we write is added as a node to this tree.

Using JavaScript, we can access any of these nodes (HTML elements) and update their styles, attributes, and so on. In short, the DOM allows JavaScript to easily access and modify a web page.

Every tree must have a root node, right? Here, the root node is document. This document node is part of the browser itself. Any HTML tag you write will be a direct or indirect child of the root node document.

(The author included an image showing the tree structure of the DOM, with document as the root and HTML tags as its children.)
